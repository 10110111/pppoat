* Interfaces:
	int pppoat_ctrl_read(int fd, struct pppoat_ctrl_state *state);
	int pppoat_ctrl_read_buf(void *buf, size_t len,
				 struct pppoat_ctrl_state *state);
	int ..._write()
  for communication module <-> pppoat_main. These functions can return
  -EAGAIN and save their state. read() returns ORed flags sent by write();
  other type of communication isn't supported.
