PPPoAT - PPP over Any Transport

Inspired by pppoj (PPP over Jabber)

Usage: pppoat [options] [<local_ip>:<remote_ip>] [-- [pppd options]]
Options:
 -h, --help	print this text and exit
 -l, --list	print list of available modules and exit
 -m <module>	choose module
 -q, --quiet	don't print anything to stdout

Available modules:
sample	do nothing
loop	create loopback
xmpp	PPP over XMPP protocol

Pay attention, pppd need to recognize local ip address for pppX interface.
Therefore you must set <local_ip> on each side or set <local_ip>:<remote_ip> on one of them.


loop module
============

Currently you can test in the following way: run two instances of pppoat with
root privileges, for example
	sudo ./pppoat -m loop 10.0.0.1:
	sudo ./pppoat -m loop 10.0.0.2:
This will create two interfaces pppX with appropriate ip addresses. Output
traffic for the fisrt one is input for the second and vise versa.


xmpp module
============

In developing...


sample module
==============

Don't use it.
