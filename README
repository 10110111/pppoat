PPPoAT - PPP over Any Transport

Inspired by pppoj (PPP over Jabber)

Currently you can test in the following way: run two instances of pppoat with root privileges, for example
	sudo ./pppoat 10.0.0.1:
	sudo ./pppoat 10.0.0.2:
This will create two interfaces pppX with appropriate ip addresses. Output traffic for the fisrt one is input for the second and vise versa.
