PPPoAT - PPP over Any Transport

PPPoAT creates point-to-point tunnel over a transport. The transport can be
any software realisation which sends data from one pppoat instance to another.

PPPoAT features:
  * Multiple network interface types: PPP, TUN/TAP driver
  * Easy platform for implementation of new transports

List of few possible transports:
  * Network protocol from any layer (IP, TCP, XMPP, HTTP, etc)
  * High level logic over a protocol (e.g. traffic encryption, obfuscation,
    sending over multiple paths, etc)
  * Usage of a media without network stack over it (physical port/bus ?)

Available transports:
  udp		Tunnel over UDP
  xmpp		Tunnel over XMPP protocol (Jabber)

/!\ New version is under development and doesn't work yet.
